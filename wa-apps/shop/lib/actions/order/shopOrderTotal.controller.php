 * 2) If you clicked to recalculate the discount, then it is transferred to 'calculate'. In the order logs the text 'discount for the ordered goods is saved:' And the information on the items is written down.
 * 3) If the discount is not touched, then we do not transfer anything and we do not display anything on the order logs.

 * Old order.
 * 1) If you enter a discount hands, then the input value is passed. In the logs of the order, the text is saved, that the discount was entered by the hands when editing.
 * 2) If you clicked to recalculate the discount, then it is transferred to 'calculate'. In the order logs the text 'discount for the ordered goods is saved:' And the information on the items is written down.
 * 3) If the discount is not touched, and before the discount was not there, then nothing is transferred and in the logs of the order is not deduced.
